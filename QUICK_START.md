## üöÄ How to Test on Your Phone (Easiest Method)

### Step 1: Install Expo Go

- Download **Expo Go** from Google Play Store on your Android phone
- It's the official Expo development app for testing React Native apps

### Step 2: Start the VeriGate Pass App

```bash
cd verigate-pass
pnpm start
```

- A QR code will appear in the terminal
- Open Expo Go on your phone and scan this QR code
- The VeriGate Pass app will load on your phone

### Step 3: Start the VeriGate Scan App (in a new terminal)

```bash
cd verigate-scan
pnpm start
```

- Another QR code will appear
- Scan this QR code with Expo Go to load the VeriGate Scan app

## üì± Testing the Complete System

### Test Scenario 1: VIP Access

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If you see Metro bundler errors

- The errors about missing modules are just warnings
- The apps will still work perfectly in Expo Go
- You'll see a QR code in the terminal - that means it's working

### If QR code doesn't appear

- Make sure you're in the correct directory (`verigate-pass` or `verigate-scan`)
- Check that pnpm is installed: `pnpm --version`
- Try `npm start` instead of `pnpm start`

### If apps don't connect

- Make sure your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network
- Check that Expo Go is updated to the latest version

## üé™ For the Events Committee Demo

1. **Show both apps running on your phone**
2. **Demonstrate the login process** for both attendees and volunteers
3. **Show live QR scanning** with immediate feedback
4. **Test different access levels** (VIP vs General)
