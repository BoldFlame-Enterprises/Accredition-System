### Step 2: Start the QR Generator App

```bash
cd qr-generator-app
pnpm start
```

- A QR code will appear in the terminal
- Open Expo Go on your phone and scan this QR code
- The QR Generator app will load on your phone

### Step 3: Start the Scanner App (in a new terminal)

```bash
cd scanner-app
pnpm start
```

- Another QR code will appear
- Scan this QR code with Expo Go to load the Scanner app

## üì± Testing the Complete System

2. **Scanner App**:
   - Login with: `scanner1@event.com`
   - Select area: "VIP Lounge"

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If you see Metro bundler errors

- The errors about missing modules are just warnings
- The apps will still work perfectly in Expo Go
- You'll see a QR code in the terminal - that means it's working

### If QR code doesn't appear

- Make sure you're in the correct directory (`qr-generator-app` or `scanner-app`)
- Check that pnpm is installed: `pnpm --version`
- Try `npm start` instead of `pnpm start`

### If apps don't connect

- Make sure your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network
- Check that Expo Go is updated to the latest version
